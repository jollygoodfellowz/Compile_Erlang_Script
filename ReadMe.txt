compile_erl.txt was designed to streamline the compilation process of Erlang. 

In compile_erl.txt we make a few assumptions. The first one being that the script file is in the same directory as the .erl file you want tocompile. Secondly we assume the file only has one occurence of .erl. Lastly, we assume that to open the erlang shell your command line takes the command "erl". That's it!

Feel free to modify to suit your needs. Please give credit if you decide to use the file!
